In this project, I reproduce some panels in figure 2 & 5 from a Nature paper published in 2024 mainly using bioinformatics/computational biology:  
"Cellular communities reveal trajectories of brain ageing and Alzheimer’s disease"  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07871-6   
This paper used 1.65 million single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals.
